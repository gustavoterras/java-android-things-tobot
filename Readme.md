# ToboT

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tscholze/java-android-things-tobot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tscholze/java-android-things-tobot)

ToboT is a [Android Things](https://developer.android.com/things/index.html) app to move a vehicle based on the [Pimoroni STS Pi](https://shop.pimoroni.de/products/sts-pi) Kit. The complete set of features is still unknown.
I'll update the readme file if a more clearer vision of the project is available.
